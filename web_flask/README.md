### [7. Improve engines](./models/engine/file_storage.py)
* Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:

Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)
* Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects

Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)
* Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) [tips](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/contextual.html) or close() on the class Session [tips](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html)

Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present
* If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State


### [8. List of states](./web_flask/7-states_list.py)
* Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
* Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
* You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
* After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
    * Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
    * Call in this method storage.close()
* Routes:
    * /states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
        * H1 tag: “States”
        * UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
        * LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
* Import this [7-dump](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/290/7-states_list.sql) to have some data
* You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

IMPORTANT
* Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
* Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

### [10. States and State](./web_flask/9-states.py)
* Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
* Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
* You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
* To load all cities of a State:
    * If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
    * Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
* After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
    * Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
    * Call in this method storage.close()
* Routes:
        /states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
            H1 tag: “States”
            UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) [tip](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.9.x/templates/)
                LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
        /states/<id>: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
            If a State object is found with this id:
                H1 tag: “State: ”
                H3 tag: “Cities:”
                UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
   * H1 tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
   * Otherwise:
      * H1 tag: “Not found!”
* You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
* Import this 7-dump to have some data

IMPORTANT
* Make sure you have a running and valid setup_mysql_dev.sql in your AirBnB_clone_v2 repository (Task)
* Make sure all tables are created when you run echo "quit" | HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

      * Use 8-index.html content as source code for the template 100-hbnb.html:
      * Replace the content of the H4 tag under each filter title (H3 States and H3 Amenities) by &nbsp;
